That's why we now give a full refund if we receive the unused item within the first 14 days of receipt. To make a return simply fill out our <a href=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0873/1243/3432/files/RETURNEXCHANGEFORM.pdf?v=1736177625\" title=\"https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0873/1243/3432/files/RETURNEXCHANGEFORM.pdf?v=1736177625\"><strong>Return/Exchange Form</strong></a>, follow the instructions and send it back with the item. <strong>Shipping is not refundable.</strong> Any product that has been installed or used in any way will not be accepted for return. <strong>All </strong><em><strong>*Made-to-Order</strong></em><strong> or </strong><em><strong>*Special Order</strong></em><strong> marked items are not returnable/exchangeable. These items will take longer to receive. All Garage Sale items, lightbars, consoles, Dominator's, push bumpers, partitions, replacement lenses, vehicle specific parts, and other made-to-order items may not be returned for any reason.</strong> Any refused delivery will be charged a 20% restocking fee. <strong>Condensation </strong>within a lightbar is a normal and natural occurrence due to the temperature and dew point fluctuations within its enclosure. Any atmospherically vented body will undergo normal condensation cycles and with the case of a lightbar, moisture is visible on the outer lenses. The product has been designed with this phenomenon in mind and therefore all internal components have been selected or coated so that this condensation has no impact on the functionality or longevity of the lightbar. </p>",
