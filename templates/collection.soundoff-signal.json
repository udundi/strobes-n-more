Their nROADS and mpower® series are especially popular for police, fire, EMS, and utility applications, combining sleek designs with high-output performance.</p>",

They offer universal mounting options and various sizes to fit everything from compact patrol units to full-size trucks. For fleet-specific setups, SoundOff also offers vehicle-specific brackets and mounting kits.</p>",

            "question": "How does SoundOff Signal’s nROADS technology improve visibility?",
            "answer": "<p>nROADS (Narrow Reflector Optic And Diode System) uses precise reflector optics to focus and direct LED light more efficiently. This results in sharper intensity, wider horizontal spread, and reduced glare, making emergency vehicles more visible at greater distances and sharper angles, especially in complex traffic situations.</p>",

            "question": "What are the differences between SoundOff Signal LED and halogen warning lights?",
            "answer": "<p>LED lights from SoundOff Signal are significantly brighter, more energy-efficient, and longer-lasting than halogen lights. LEDs turn on instantly, don’t require warm-up time, and are solid-state, meaning fewer parts to break or burn out. Halogen lights are outdated by comparison, with shorter lifespans and higher power draw.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Installation typically involves mounting the light bar, connecting to a 12V power source, and wiring to a control panel or switch box. Programming is done through SoundOff’s BluePRINT control system or compatible interfaces, allowing full customization of flash patterns, colors, zones, and sync features. Clear wiring diagrams and install kits are available for most setups.</p>",
