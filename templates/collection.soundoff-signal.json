            "question": "How does SoundOff Signal’s nROADS technology improve visibility?",
            "answer": "<p>nROADS (Narrow Reflector Optic And Diode System) uses precise reflector optics to focus and direct LED light more efficiently. This results in sharper intensity, wider horizontal spread, and reduced glare, making emergency vehicles more visible at greater distances and sharper angles, especially in complex traffic situations.</p>",

            "question": "What are the differences between SoundOff Signal LED and halogen warning lights?",
            "answer": "<p>LED lights from SoundOff Signal are significantly brighter, more energy-efficient, and longer-lasting than halogen lights. LEDs turn on instantly, don’t require warm-up time, and are solid-state, meaning fewer parts to break or burn out. Halogen lights are outdated by comparison, with shorter lifespans and higher power draw.</p>",
