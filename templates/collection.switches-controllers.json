Some are simple on/off designs, while others offer multiple outputs or momentary functions. Many switches are also backlit or labeled for emergency, work, or auxiliary lighting.</p>",

Ground the light and ensure proper amperage for the circuit. For setups with multiple lights or flash patterns, use a relay or control module to manage load and protect the switch.</p>",

However, some OEM-style switches are vehicle-specific, built to match factory styling and connectors. Always check sizing, voltage, and mounting dimensions before purchasing.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Look for switches with built-in fuses or circuit protection, water-resistant or weather-sealed designs, and LED indicators for active status. For emergency or high-power setups, choose switches rated for higher amperage and use with a relay to prevent overheating or circuit failure.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Yes, a single switch can control multiple lights if they’re wired in parallel and the total current doesn’t exceed the switch’s rating. For larger setups, using a relay or control box is safer and more reliable. Some multi-function switches also allow independent control of zones or flash patterns.</p>",
