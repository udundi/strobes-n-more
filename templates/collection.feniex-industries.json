The Fusion-S offers single-color, high-intensity output with 40° or 180° optics for focused or wide-angle coverage. The Quad series is fully customizable with four colors per module.

            "answer": "<p>Fusion technology allows users to choose between 40° narrow optics for focused forward warning or 180° wide optics for maximum side visibility. This flexibility helps tailor each light to its exact mounting position and function, improving visibility and safety while reducing glare or light waste.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Yes, Feniex lights are built for harsh environments. Most units carry IP67 or higher ratings, meaning they’re dust-tight and water-resistant for use in rain, snow, mud, or off-road conditions. The housings are built from rugged materials to withstand vibration, UV exposure, and extreme temperatures.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Most Feniex lights operate on a 12V DC system, which is standard for emergency and fleet vehicles. Some models can handle 10–16V ranges, and higher-end setups may use control boxes or relay modules to manage multiple lights. Always check individual product specs for current draw and fuse requirements.</p>",

            "question": "Can Feniex lights be synchronized with other emergency lighting systems?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes, many Feniex lights can sync with other Feniex products using built-in sync wires or through the Feniex Module Programmer (FMP). Syncing with other brands may be possible but depends on flash pattern compatibility and wiring configurations. For best performance and full feature access, stick with an all-Feniex setup.</p>",
