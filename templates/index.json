            "answer": "<p>LED warning lights are brighter, last longer, and use less power than halogen or strobe lights. They’re also more durable, with solid-state construction that resists shock and vibration. Unlike halogen, LEDs don’t generate much heat, and they don’t require the high-voltage systems that strobes do. This means fewer maintenance issues and better reliability in the field.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>High-quality LED warning lights typically last 50,000 to 100,000 hours. That’s significantly longer than halogen or strobe lights, which often need replacement after a few thousand hours. LEDs also degrade slowly over time, rather than failing abruptly, which adds to their long-term reliability.</p>",

For work trucks, amber LEDs are most common. For emergency response, color combinations like red/blue or red/white may be used (where legal). Look for high-output, weatherproof lights with multiple flash patterns and rugged construction.<br/></p>",

Amber lights are generally allowed for warning purposes, while red or blue is restricted to authorized vehicles. The rules vary by state and application (e.g., utility, tow, emergency), so it’s important to confirm compliance with both federal and state laws.<br/></p>",
