        "text": "<h2>Who is Whelen Engineering?</h2><p><a href=\"https://www.whelen.com/about-us\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Whelen Engineering</span></a> has been designing and manufacturing emergency warning equipment in the United States since 1952. What started in a Connecticut garage has grown into a pair of large facilities in Connecticut and New Hampshire, with over a million square feet of manufacturing space and a team of roughly 1,500 employees.</p><p>Their mission is simple: protect the people who protect everyone else. To do that, Whelen designs, sources, and builds its warning lights, scene lighting, sirens, and controllers in-house, rigorously testing each product to demanding industry standards. That American-made, first-responder–focused approach is a key reason fleets stay loyal to Whelen decade after decade.</p><h2>What Whelen Products You’ll Find in This Collection</h2><p>Strobes N’ More’s Whelen collection brings together a wide range of categories: 360° beacons, LED lightheads, lightbars, traffic advisors, sirens, speakers, and Core control hardware, plus mounting hardware and strap kits.</p><h3>LED Lightheads & Perimeter Lighting</h3><p>You’ll find popular surface-mounted and hide-away solutions such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Micron™ and ION™ series</strong> – ultra-compact, rugged Super-LED® lightheads designed to survive harsh environments while delivering intense warning output in tight mounting spaces.</li><li><strong>M Series® and Hundred Series</strong> lightheads – larger housings with patented Linear-LED® optics, wide viewing angles, and multiple flash patterns suitable for fire, EMS, DOT, and utility fleets.</li></ul><p>These lightheads give you flexible mounting on grilles, bumpers, mirrors, fenders, rocker panels, rear hatch areas, and more, so you can build full 360° coverage around the vehicle.</p><h3>Full-Size & Mini Lightbars</h3><p>For maximum visibility, the collection includes full-size and mini Whelen lightbars in both single-color and DUO® configurations. Examples include Century™, Liberty II®, Legacy®, and Justice® packages featuring:</p><ul><li>High-intensity corner modules and long-range warning</li><li>Options for takedowns, alleys, and traffic advisor functions</li><li>WeCanX®-ready designs for advanced control and syncing</li><li>SAE Class 1 performance on many models for professional duty</li></ul><p>Mini bars offer similar technology in smaller footprints for POVs, command vehicles, and lighter-duty applications.</p><h3>Rear, Spoiler, and Edge Systems</h3><p>Products like Whelen Outer Edge® rear-facing systems mount above the rear window or spoiler, using multiple ION® lightheads in a single housing. They provide strong rear warning and can operate as a traffic advisor, while hard-coated lenses and sealed electronics resist moisture, chemicals, and vibration.</p><h3>Sirens, Speakers & Whelen Core® Control</h3><p>Beyond lighting, Strobes N’ More stocks Whelen sirens, speakers, and Core® control systems (like Core-C™) that act as the “brain” of a modern warning package. These controllers tie your lightbars, lightheads, and sirens into one programmable system, support advanced features like synchronized patterns and low-power modes, and integrate cleanly with today’s work trucks and patrol vehicles.<a href=\"https://www.whelen.com/\"> </a></p><h3>Mounts, Strap Kits & Replacement Parts</h3><p>Because a good install is as important as the gear itself, the collection also includes:</p><ul><li>Vehicle-specific strap kits and universal mounts</li><li>Lightbar mounts, brackets, and hardware</li><li>Replacement lenses and other service parts</li></ul><p>That means you can spec, mount, and maintain Whelen equipment from a single source.</p><h2>Key Features & Technology of Whelen Vehicle Lights</h2><p>Across lightheads, lightbars, and accessories, Whelen technology focuses on performance and survivability in real-world conditions:</p><ul><li><strong>Super-LED® & Linear-LED® optics</strong> – proprietary LED and optic designs that push more usable light where it’s needed, with excellent off-axis visibility.</li><li><strong>Multiple flash patterns & DVI™ options</strong> – built-in pattern libraries (often 20+ patterns) let you tailor warning behavior to pursuit, blocking, directing, or scene work, with newer products using Dynamic Variable Intensity™ for more intuitive signaling.</li><li><strong>E Block™ and advanced thermal design</strong> – efficient electronics and thermal management protect LEDs during extended dwell times, supporting long-term reliability.</li><li><strong>WeCanX® network compatibility</strong> – many bars and heads are ready for Whelen’s networked control environment, enabling precise programming, syncing, and expansion as vehicles evolve.</li><li><strong>Rugged, weather-sealed builds</strong> – polycarbonate lenses, encapsulated electronics, and sealed housings are designed to withstand vibration, moisture, UV exposure, and de-icing chemicals.</li></ul><p>For fleets, this means fewer failures, simpler programming across vehicles, and lighting that still performs years into service.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Whelen Setup</h2><p>When you browse the Whelen collection at Strobes N’ More, it helps to think in layers:</p><p><strong>1. Primary warning</strong></p><ul><li>Patrol/response: full-size lightbar + perimeter lightheads (grille, mirrors, rocker panels, hatch).</li><li>Public works/utility: mini bar or beacons + a few key perimeter lights.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Directional & rear protection</strong></p><ul><li>Add traffic advisor bars or rear spoiler systems to guide traffic around scenes and improve rear-end visibility.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Scene and work lighting</strong></p><ul><li>Use Pioneer™ or other scene lights, flood/spot modules, and compartment lighting where personnel load gear or work outside the vehicle.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Control & future-proofing</strong></p><ul><li>Consider a Whelen Core® controller when you want one “brain” to manage lights and sirens, simplify driver training, and keep future add-ons organized.</li></ul><p>If you’re building or standardizing a fleet, you can choose a core set of Whelen products from this collection and apply the same logic across sedans, SUVs, pickups, and heavy trucks.</p><h2>Why Buy Whelen from Strobes N’ More?</h2><p><a href=\"https://strobesnmore.com/\" title=\"LED Emergency Vehicle Lights & Accessories | Strobes N’ More\">Strobes N’ More</a> is a specialized emergency-vehicle outfitting retailer, not a generic auto parts site. They focus on trusted brands—Whelen included—and stock a broad mix of lightbars, lightheads, sirens, mounts, and Core control hardware, with plenty of model-specific options and package deals.</p><p>You also get practical perks: clear product descriptions and specs, reviews from other first responders and fleet users, install resources and videos, and a support team familiar with Whelen’s product line. That combination makes this Whelen collection a strong starting point, whether you’re upgrading a single rig or planning a department-wide refresh.</p>",
