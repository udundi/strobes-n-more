            "answer": "<p>Top-rated amber LED light bars include models from ECCO, Feniex, Whelen, and Xprite. Look for features like high-output LEDs, multiple flash patterns, weather-sealed housings, and low-profile designs. Full-size rooftop bars and mini bars with magnetic mounts are both popular for work truck applications like plowing, utility service, and road maintenance.</p>",

            "question": "Are amber LED light bars suitable for off-road use?",
            "answer": "<p>Yes. Amber LED light bars are excellent for off-road use, especially in dusty, foggy, or low-visibility conditions. Amber light cuts through airborne particles better than white light, reducing glare and improving trail visibility. They're commonly used on UTVs, trucks, and support vehicles in backcountry environments.</p>",

            "question": "Can amber LED light bars be mounted on a roof rack?",
            "answer": "<p>Absolutely. Many amber light bars are designed to mount on roof racks, using brackets, U-bolts, or magnetic bases. Make sure the light bar size fits your rack and that it’s secured with weather-rated hardware. Wiring can typically be routed along the rack and through the vehicle’s firewall or accessory port.</p>",

            "question": "What power sources are available for amber LED light bars?",
            "answer": "<p>Amber LED light bars typically run on 12V or 24V DC systems, drawing power from the vehicle’s battery or accessory circuit. Options include hardwiring, plug-and-play cigarette lighter adapters, or quick-connect harnesses. Some models also support use with switch panels or relays for full control.</p>",

            "question": "Do amber LED light bars come with wireless remote control?",
            "answer": "<p>Some models do. Selected amber LED bars come with wireless remotes that let you change flash patterns, turn the light on/off, and adjust brightness. These are especially handy for temporary or portable setups. For more permanent installs, many users prefer hardwired switches or dash-mounted control boxes for reliability.</p>",
