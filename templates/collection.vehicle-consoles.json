These consoles are built for rugged use and designed to fit radios, sirens, light controls, and other equipment. Look for vehicle-specific models that offer secure mounting, ergonomic access, and modular configurations.</p>",

            "question": "How do I install a custom automotive console?",
            "answer": "<p>Installing a custom console usually involves removing the factory center console and bolting the new unit directly to the vehicle’s floor or mounting brackets. Wiring for radios, lighting controls, and power ports is routed through cutouts or pre-drilled panels. Some installs are plug-and-play, but others may require light fabrication—professional installation is recommended for complex setups.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Both types exist. Universal consoles can fit a range of vehicles but may require extra mounting hardware or adjustments. Vehicle-specific consoles are tailored to the make and model for a clean, secure fit and easier installation. For emergency vehicles, vehicle-specific options are preferred for durability and optimal layout.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Many consoles offer integrated storage such as locking compartments, cup holders, document trays, and slots for flashlights or handcuffs. Modular accessories like armrests, clipboard holders, or keyboard trays can also be added, depending on the model. Storage is often customizable to suit the needs of law enforcement or fleet operators.</p>",

            "answer": "<p>Yes, most emergency vehicle consoles are designed to house lighting control panels, siren systems, and radio units. They include faceplates and mounting slots that match common control heads. This keeps everything centralized, accessible, and neatly organized for quick use during operations.</p>",
